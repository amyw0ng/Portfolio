## History of Sales Patterns in Canada in the Last 10 Years
Retail sales show an overall growth over the last 10 years but also exhibits seasonal patterns. For example, sales tend to drop in January and rise in the Spring before shooting up dramatically during the Winter which corresponds with the Christmas holidays being a big season for spending overall. The blue area highlighted represents when Covid-19 surfaced in Canada and we can see a very clear dip in sales in April when the first Covid-19 wave was at it's peak.

## Relationship between Covid-19 Cases and Retail Sales
When looking more closely at the rise and fall of Covid-19 cases in Canada, we see that the largest impact of Covid-19 on retail sales was most apparent during the first wave. Interestingly enough, sales overall recovered quite well in the second and third wave (when we take into consideration the seasonal patterns as described before for the wave that occurred during the Christmas season).

## Retail Sales by Industry during the Rise and Fall of Covid-19 Cases
In looking at each industry individually, we found that the automotive industry (blue), gas (light green), and clothing industries (dark orange) experienced the biggest dips in sales during the first covid wave. Where as other industries like the marijuana or food/beverages industries were not impacted overall.

## Percentage Change in Sales by Industry during each Covid-19 Wave
We can see the changes by industry more clearly when we look at their overall percentage change during each wave of the pandemic. Please note that for luxury goods, we did have some null data so although it was included in the visualizations, the data should not be taken into consideration when drawing conclusions.

Overall, we see quite clearly that many industries were impacted during the first wave of Covid-19 but many of them recovered quite well during the next two waves of Covid-19.

## Rise of E-Commerce in the Wake of Covid-19
Although there was an impact on spending habits in the beginning, we can see that as Covid-19 continued many industries were able to recover quite well in the following waves. One hypothesis on how we were able to adapt so well to the new lifestyle introduced as a result of the pandemic was the dramatic rise in e-commerce.
