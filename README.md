# Hi, I'm Amy and I'm a Data Analyst
Welcome to my portfolio repository, where you'll find some projects I've done, whether from the Juno College Data Analytics Bootcamp or just personal projects on topics I found interesting. I use a range of tools like Excel, SQL, Tableau or Python to explore a variety of topics. 

Take a look around and enjoy your stay!

# Projects

## 1. Retention and Win-Streaks in a Mobile Game App
This was a group project in which we had to use BigQuery(SQL) to examine the 30-day retention rate for a sample dataset of a mobile game app. Using the player and match information, we also chose to look at the correlation between a player's win-streak within the first 30 days and whether or not they were retained after that period.

## 2. Impact of Covid-19 on Canada's Retail Industries
Given the impact of Covid-19 in dramatically changing our lifestyles, I wanted to explore it's impact on different retail industries in Canada. For this, I used SQL to combine information from John Hopkins on the Covid-19 cases in Canada and retail sales information from Stats Canada to look at changes in sales patterns by industry. The relationships in the data were visualized in Tableau. [Link to files.]()

## 3. Cluster Analysis of Customer Types
Using only Tableau, we took a dataset from Kaggle and used cluster analysis to identify distinct customer types based on their spending patterns, income and  to evaluate the success of ad campaigns. [Link to files.]()

## 4. Linear Regression Analysis of Player Stats in League of Legends
For this project, I used the League of Legends Worlds 2021 Play-in Tournament data to examine the relationship between player stats and their team's success in winning in the tournament. Exploratory data analysis was done in Jupyter Notebook (Python) and a linear regression model was used to determine what aspects of the game were the best predictors of a player's kills to deaths ratio.

## 5. Classification Model for Heart Disease
Heart disease often presents symptoms differently between men and women. To illustrate this, I conducted hyperparameter tuning on a Random Forest classification model to predict the presence of heart disease and examine the factors that are most important for identifying heart disease in men and women and how they differ by gender.
